# Probabalistic_Graph_Residual
The full paper describing our project's methodology, strenghts and weaknesses can be found [Report](ProRES_CISS.pdf)

* Replaces the L21 norm in the original AirGNN implementation by computing the distance between probability distributions of all neighboring node features to estimate if they are poisoned.

* Our model is located in AirGNN

AirGNN_OG holds the original AirGNN

* AirGNN2 is junk code (not to be used).
